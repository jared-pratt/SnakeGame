TRON Snake Game
Description
Welcome to our TRON-inspired Snake Game! It's the classic Snake gameplay you know, but set in a neon TRON world. Navigate your snake around the grid, collect energy cells, avoid crashing into the walls or your own trail, and see how long you can survive.

This isn't your grandpa's snake game—this one glows!

How to Play
Use the arrow keys or WASD to steer your snake.

Collect energy cells to grow longer and increase your score.

Avoid crashing into walls or your glowing tail—it's game over if you do.

Special TRON Features
Neon Visuals: Authentic TRON-style graphics that glow as you play.

Retro Soundtrack: Immerse yourself with electronic beats straight from the grid.
